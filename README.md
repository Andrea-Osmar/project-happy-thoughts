# Happy Thoughts ðŸ’Ÿ

This weeks project was to create a "twitter-like app", with less bullshit and more love. We have practised fetching and posting data to an API as well as using React state and react hooks.

## Learning Objectives:

- How to use API's in React,
- How to use React state to show content of the API result
- How to work with an API where you both send and receive data.
- Lifecycle of a component

# Tech ðŸ’—

- React
- React Hooks
- JSX
- API
- CSS
